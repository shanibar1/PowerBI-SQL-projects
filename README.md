# Final Project - BI System for Business Data Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on the development of a **Business Intelligence (BI)** system designed to help the company analyze its business data, including product sales, customer behaviors, and profitability. The system aggregates data from multiple sources and provides actionable insights using advanced queries, views, reports, and visual dashboards.

### Key Features:
- **SQL Queries**: Business-critical queries that analyze product sales, customer behaviors, and profitability.
- **Views and Functions**: Created views for aggregating data and functions to evaluate product popularity, revenue, and customer membership status.
- **Stored Procedures**: Automates key business processes like updating product discounts and calculating customer membership priorities.
- **Power BI Dashboards and Reporting**: Provides visual reports and dashboards to track product performance, sales trends, and customer engagement.

## Technologies Used
- **SQL Server**: Used to manage and query relational data.
- **T-SQL**: For writing advanced queries, creating views, stored procedures, and functions.
- **Power BI**: For data visualization, dashboard creation, and interactive reporting.
  
## Tasks Completed

### 1. **Logical Design (Data Model)**
In this task, a relational data model was created with entities representing products, orders, customers, and transactions. Key tables include:
- **PRODUCTS**: Product details, including name, barcode, price, and product type.
- **ORDERS**: Information about orders placed by customers, linked to products.
- **CUSTOMERS**: Data about the customers, including their membership level and purchasing behavior.
- **CREDIT CARDS**: Information on customers' credit cards linked to their profiles.
- **INVENTORY**: Tracks product stock levels and supplies.

### 2. **SQL Queries (Business Analysis)**
Several critical queries were designed to extract valuable insights:
- **Top 10 Customers by Revenue**: Find the top 10 customers generating the highest revenue, grouped by country.
- **Sales by Product Version**: Identify products sold in multiple versions over the past six months.
- **Revenue Comparison by Year**: Compare revenue generated by products in 2021 and 2022.
- **Shipping Methods Usage**: Analyze which shipping methods are preferred by customers.
- **Least Profitable Products**: Identify products with low profitability based on sales data.

### 3. **Data Representation Tools (Power BI Reports and Views)**
- **Power BI Dashboard**: The Power BI dashboard aggregates data into an easy-to-read format, with key metrics such as:
  - **Total Revenue by Product**: Breakdown of total revenue per product.
  - **Sales Trends**: Visual representation of sales over time.
  - **Product Performance**: Evaluates the best and least performing products.
  - **Customer Insights**: Shows active customer segments and preferred product categories.
  
- **Views**: Predefined views for summarizing data such as the total revenue per product, the number of orders per customer, and sales by country.
- **Reports**: Comprehensive business reports showcasing sales trends, revenue distribution, and product performance. These are used by management to make informed decisions.

### 4. **Stored Procedures and Functions**
- **Discount Update Procedure**: A stored procedure for applying discounts to selected products.
- **Membership Function**: A function to calculate the membership level of a customer based on their order history and activity.
- **Sales Growth Function**: A function to measure sales growth for each product over time, comparing current and previous years.

### 5. **Business Intelligence Dashboard**
The Power BI dashboard aggregates the data and presents it in a user-friendly format with:
- **Sales Performance**: Total sales and revenue per product category.
- **Customer Insights**: Active members, purchasing patterns, and preferred products.
- **Profitability Analysis**: Evaluating the profitability of each product and identifying areas for improvement.

### 6. **Advanced Queries with Window Functions**
- Window functions were used to analyze sales trends over time and calculate metrics such as cumulative revenue, average sales per month, and product profitability.

## How to Use the System

1. **Run Queries**: Use SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or a compatible SQL tool to run the provided SQL queries.
2. **Access Views**: Access predefined views to get insights into sales, revenue, and product performance.
3. **Generate Reports**: Use Power BI to visualize reports and dashboards, providing easy access to critical business insights.
4. **Apply Procedures**: Use stored procedures to automate certain business processes like product discount updates.

## Future Enhancements
- **Advanced Analytics**: Integrate machine learning models to predict customer behavior and product sales trends.
- **Mobile Dashboard**: Develop a mobile-friendly version of the Power BI dashboard to allow management to access business metrics on the go.
- **Integration with CRM Systems**: Link the system with CRM platforms to provide a more comprehensive view of customer engagement and sales efforts.
